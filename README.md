# Desktop Schlatt

This is horribly programmed, i am so sorry if you decide to read the source


## TODO
* Add checks to make sure we are not doing the same task twice
* checks for time, if its after certain time sing a sleep song
* sing songs at random times
* polish
* possibly cut things if run out of time before filming video



## Possibly updates
* Add gaming headset to schlatt when he's taking over the keyboard
* mouth move when talking - Switching between two images HAHA
 
## Qwerks
If your display zoom settings are anything other than ```100%```, the display for the text box will be broken


## Config
By default all functions are enabled. you can turn some of them off in the ```Config.json``` file

You can add custom messages in the ```Messages.txt``` file, but he wont be able to say your messages.
At the moment if you want custom messages that will be said, you will have to rename the audio file and the line in ```Messages.txt``` related
